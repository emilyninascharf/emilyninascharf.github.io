                    <h4>My Story</h4>
                    <p>I have nearly 6 years of applied experience in UXR, Consumer Insights, and Market Research, with both agency and client side experience. Employers and clients include Vevo, T-Mobile, Salesforce, and GAF. My work leans quantitative with a masters in quant methods from Columbia University, but I do also have qualitative experience.
