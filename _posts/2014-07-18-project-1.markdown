<h3>Background</h3>

<!-- ![image](img/portfolio/lady_gaga.jpeg) -->

Vevo was seeking to rely less on YouTube for revenue. As Connected TV poised to take over advertising budget, Vevo and media agency Magna teamed up to maximize resources for a diary study.

<h3>Research Questions</h3>

- What are the motivations behind device choice?
- How receptive are consumers to advertising by device? Does attention vary by device?
- How can advertisers optimize across devices?

<h3>Methodology</h3>

A nationally representative online panel of 3500 wrote a diary of daily video consumption. Diary entries covered 9,613 video sessions and included:
- *Why* - Motivations for watching and selection of device
- *What* - Video content type, genre, how the selection was made
- *When* - Time of day and day of week
- *Where* - Everything associated with environment
- *Who* - Ethnicity/race, generation, gender, etc.

<h3>Results</h3> 

- Co-viewers are especially attentive to advertising on CTV, and music content lends itself to co-viewing
There is more passive discovery of content on CTV than on desktop or mobile.
- While audio is understandably important when watching music content on any device, visuals are most important on CTV compared to other devices.
- Time of day, task at hand, and location are the strongest drivers of device choice - CTV in particular is ideal for when consumers want variety in content at home.

<h3>Impact</h3>

The press made Vevo and Magna leaders and tastemakers in the CTV ad market for everything from length of ad breaks to multicultural programming. 
Today 27% of all of Vevoâ€™s views come from its 35 CTV partnerships, compared to 5% of views across 7 partnerships at the time of the study.
CTV partnerships include Free Ad Supported TV (FAST) channels - one channel, Vevo Pop, would go on to win the 2023 Digiday Best FAST Channel Award.
