<h3>Background</h3>

Vevo is the music video partner of all UMG and Sony labels on YouTube. A channel on Vevo is identifiable with VEVO at the end of it (ex. KatyPerryVEVO). In October 2017, YouTube announced artist channels. These a by the artist’s full name with spaces (eg. Katy Perry). At the time, Vevo was monetizing music videos at both the video and channel level.

With the new development, Vevo stakeholders were concerned that YouTube would gain an unfair advantage in selling advertising at the channel level. 

<h3>Research Questions</h3>

How does the existence of both YouTube and Vevo channels affect the user experience with YouTube search?
How can Vevo improve chances of a consumer selecting its channels?

<h3>Methodology</h3>

A remote, unmoderated usability test of 12 participants, asking them to search for a particular artists channel, make a choice, and explain why they chose it. The test was about 10 minutes start to end

UserTesting remote study asking participants to search for specific artists and select a channel
12 participants, US based, A18-34
- “Which channel would you select and why?”
- “What do you look for when selecting a channel?”
- “What jumps out at you from each of the top two channels?”


<h3>Results</h3>

***There was a near-even split between the Official Artist channel and Vevo channel across the 36 examples in the 12 tests. However, the reasons for selecting each showed a pattern across users.***

At the time, YouTube was utilizing descriptions on their Official Artist Channels while Vevo channels were not. 

***When Vevo was selected, it was because the Vevo brand told users that the video would be “official.” When YouTube was selected, it was because the description told them unambiguously that the channel was official.***

Official in this sense meant both high quality and the intention of the artist. This study was the first to establish the specific brand equity of the Vevo name to users navigating YouTube.

<h3>Impact on Stakeholders</h3>


- *Product & engineering* - created a tool to automate adding a description for Vevo channels to make the “official” status more straightforward and less reliant on brand equity
- *Artist relations* - helped artist management teams to navigate the changes to channels on YouTube and what they mean for content artists have on YouTube through Vevo or otherwise 
- *Business development* - Was able to use brand equity findings  as leverage in later conversations with YouTube about revenue operations
